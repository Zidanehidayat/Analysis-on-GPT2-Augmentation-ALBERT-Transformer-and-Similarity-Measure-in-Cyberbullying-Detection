Source code of paper "Analysis on GPT2 Augmentation, ALBERT Transformer, and Similarity Measure in Cyberbullying Detection"

This research used dataset from previous research, can be accesed here https://github.com/rizalespe/Dataset-Sentimen-Analisis-Bahasa-Indonesia/blob/master/dataset_komentar_instagram_cyberbullying.csv.

The research stages when training and testing are carried out with Python using scikit-learn library.

Models were trained :
- Python: 3.11.11
- Processor: 12th Generation Intel Core i7
- Memory: 32 GB
- Storage: 1 TB SSD
- Graphics Card: Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB
- Operating System: Windows 11

To maintain consistency, we use a value of random state 42 for all models.
